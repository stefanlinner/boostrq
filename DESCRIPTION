Description: Boosting Regression Quantiles is a component-wise boosting algorithm, 
             that embeds all boosting steps in the well-established framework 
             of quantile regression. It is initialized with the corresponding quantile, 
             uses a quantile-specific learning rate, and uses quantile regression as its base learner.
             The package implements this algorithm and allows cross-validation and stability selection.
